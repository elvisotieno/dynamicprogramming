#You are given a zero-indexed array A consisting of n integers: a0, a1, . . . , anâˆ’1.
# Array A represents a scenario in a grocery store, and contains only 0s and/or 1s:
# 0  represents the action of a new person joining the line in the grocery store,
# 1 represents the action of the person at the front of the queue being served and leaving the line.
#The goal is to count the minimum number of people who should have been in the line before
#the above scenario, so that the scenario is possible
# (it is not possible to serve a person if the line is empty).

# idea:  We should remember the size of the queue and carry out a simulation of people arriving at and leaving the grocery store.
# If the size of the queue becomes a negative number
# then that sets the lower limit for the number of people who had to stand in the line previously.
